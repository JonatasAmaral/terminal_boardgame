<br />

In this repo lives a small turn based "board game" to run over python terminal.

It's purpose is to serve as an example/guide project on a _programming logic_ course i do minister. And it made use of **basic** programing concepts and structures.

This repo holds multiples steps of the developing process. And some commits may have incomplete and/or not functional code

It is saved here for future _in class_ code reviewing and improving, and also as a starting repo for teaching GIT.

## Lore 💬

It's funnier if a project has purpose, meaning and a history backing it up, so here it go:

<em>

You woke up, it's **3a.m.**, and hungry comes pay you a visit.

You gotta go have a snack, but for sure your dog did poop somewhere. Better not step on it, and lose your appetite.

But hey. It's devil's hour!!!
It may have something spooking around... Should be carefull on the way.

## Mecanics 🕹️

🎲 A _boardgame_, so you face a finite 2D grid, with discrete positions you can be in.

🚦 It's _turn based_, so game awaits you to type in your move. If valid, time goes on, and it is performed, along with world's whatevs events

👣 You can only move one step by turn, on vertical **or** horizontal axis. No weird diagonals for you here you fool

📚 You _can't_ go over your obstacles here. Feels motivating?

💩 Poop is a stationary obstacle. You should avoid it, but it wouldn't do much to get you.

👻 Ghost in other hand, is mostly going after any yellow faceball, though may get distracted sometimes.
