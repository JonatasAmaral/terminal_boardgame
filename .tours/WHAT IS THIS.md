# WHAT IS THIS `.tours` FOLDER YOU ASK

This is a folder that keeps the files created by the VS Code's extension [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour)

This extension allows to create (and play) interactive markdown text synced to source code (as if external comments on esteroids), giving the power to easely make a in depth guide through the codebase, without flooding it with comments.

To make use of this functionality at this repo, open it in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) by cloning it in your machine (or by pressing '.' on github's repo page to open in <https://vscode.dev> ).

Install the extension, and in the Explorer tab, go to the "CODETOUR" tree view

There you have all the active tours
